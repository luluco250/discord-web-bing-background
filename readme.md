# Discord Web Bing Background

User script and style for using Bing's daily wallpapers as Discord web's
background.


To use, simply import `userscript.js` into Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey/equivalent
and `userstyle.css` into Stylus/Stylish.


There are some elements of the UI that are transparent where they shouldn't be,
such as the emoji picker, but it's minor enough not to be a problem.
